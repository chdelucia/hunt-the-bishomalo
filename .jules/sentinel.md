## 2026-03-18 - [Input Validation for Player Name]
**Vulnerability:** Lack of input validation on player name field allowed for potential UI-based DoS and served as an unvalidated entry point for XSS.
**Learning:** Even simple configuration forms should have strict validation to maintain defense-in-depth and prevent unexpected behavior.
**Prevention:** Always implement maxLength and pattern validation for user-provided strings in Angular Reactive Forms and reflect these constraints in the HTML template.
